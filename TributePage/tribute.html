                Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity,
                one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy
                of science.

                He is best known for his equation E=mc², which describes the relationship between energy and mass.
                Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect.
                Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles.He published more than 300 scientific 
                papers and 150 non-scientific ones.On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers,
                comprising more than 30,000 unique documents.Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the 
                word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists 
                on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.
